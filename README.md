## ‚ú® Features

### üîê Algorithm Visualizations

The platform provides detailed visualizations for multiple cryptographic algorithms:

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Step-by-step visualization of the AES encryption process
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: Interactive demonstration of this classic symmetric-key algorithm
- **RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)**: Visual explanation of this widely-used asymmetric algorithm
- **Blowfish**: Complete walkthrough of the Blowfish encryption and decryption process
- **SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**: Visualization of the hashing process and how it ensures data integrity
- **Quantum Key Distribution**: Introduction to next-generation quantum cryptography concepts

Each visualization includes:
- Interactive step-by-step process explanation
- Visual guides showing data transformation
- Real-time changes as you modify inputs
- Educational explanations of each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses

### üîç Key Strength Analyzer

- Compete on algorithm-specific leaderboards with other users
- Earn badges and track your progress across different security concepts

### üë§ User Authentication System

- Secure registration and login
- Email verification for account security
- Password recovery with secure token-based reset

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- TailwindCSS for styling
- FontAwesome for icons

### Backend
- Python with Flask
- MongoDB for database
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- Email verification system

## üîß Development and Deployment

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goxtham/Security-Viz-frontend.git
cd Security-Viz-frontend
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080
```

3. The backend repository is available at a separate location and requires:
   - Python 3.7+
   - MongoDB
   - Required Python packages (Flask, PyMongo, bcrypt, etc.)

### Deployment

The platform uses a distributed deployment model:
- Frontend: Hosted on GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform
- Backend: Deployed on Render.com at [security-viz-api.onrender.com](https://security-viz-api.onrender.com)
- Domain management through a custom domain provider

## üß™ Testing

The platform includes comprehensive testing for:
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Security features including CSRF protection, XSS prevention
- Authentication flow validation

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salting
- **Session Management**: Secure, HttpOnly cookies with proper SameSite attributes
- **CORS Protection**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Email verification for sensitive operations

## üì± Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Tablets
- Mobile devices
